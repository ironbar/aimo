The hexagon is equiangular, so each interior angle measures $180(6-2)/6=120$ degrees.  Extend sides $AB$, $CD$, and $EF$ and call their intersection points $G$, $H$, and $J$ as shown.  The exterior angles of the hexagon each measure $180-120=60$ degrees, so triangles $JDE$, $CBH$, $FGA$, and $JHG$ are all equilateral.  It follows that $JD=DE=4$ units and $CH=CB=7$ units.  Therefore the side length $JH$ of triangle $JGH$ is $4+2+7=13$ units.  Turning to side $HG$, we find that $AF=AG=13-(7+1)=5$ units.
