Incorrect assumptions/substitutions -> be rigorous
Use all the available information in the problem description

Problem 4
Use comments instead of code
Incorrect assumption, the factor geometric sequence needs to be integer

Problem 5
Use comments instead of code

Problem 6
Incorrect assumptions

Problem 7
Use comments instead of code

Read the problem carefully 
Use code even for the most simple operations, that will reduce the chance of mistakes.
Be careful with the assumptions you make, use only the information available in the problem description. Do not make simplifications



1. Maximize the probability of creating correct answers
2. Maximize the probability of choosing the correct answer

I could refocus on train problems once I know that zero-shot prompt and code is the way to go.
