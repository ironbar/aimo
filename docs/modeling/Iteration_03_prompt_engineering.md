## Goal

Can I improve the LB score with prompt engineering?

## Motivation

I'm going to leave the evaluation fixed: I'm going to use MATH level 5 problems (580) and I will be using 5 repetitions for each problem (confidence level 100%).

I want to try different prompt strategies:

- No code prompt
- Bad prompt
- Few-shot prompt
- Few-shot prompt with RAG
- Carefully crafted prompts

If the model is steerable by prompts I will be able to improve the LB score. If not
I will have to find another strategy.

I need to improve from my current 21 on LB score to 27, that is a +12% in accuracy that I need to get.

## TODO

- [ ] How long does it take the evaluation with 5 repetitions? around 12 hours
- [ ] Prompts to evaluate
  - [ ] CoT no code prompt
  - [ ] Minimal prompt
  - [ ] Bad prompt
  - [ ] Few-shot prompt
  - [ ] Few-shot prompt with RAG
