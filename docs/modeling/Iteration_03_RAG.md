# Iteration 3. Retrieval Augmented Generation

## Goal

Can we improve the LB score by using RAG to select the most similar problems?

## Motivation

So far we have been doing few-shot prompting with random problems. I believe that if we select
similar problems we could improve the scores. We could do that using text embeddings.
